# GizmoReloaded
An intuitive advanced building tool

This is an updated version of the amazing Gizmo project by Rolopogo (https://github.com/rolopogo/) who gave me permission to update and maintain this mod.

Client side only.

- Rotate objects in all three axes using modifier keys and the scroll wheel
- Intuitive gizmo helps visualize rotations

- Rotate in the Y (Green) plane with no modifier keys
- Rotate in the X (Red) plane with LShift (by default)
- Rotate in the Z (Blue) plane with LAlt (by default)
